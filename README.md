# Hi, I'm Marcos 👋

I’m a student interested in **physics, mathematics, and scientific programming**

I enjoy working on small experimental projects where code is used not just to *work*, but to **test ideas, limits, and assumptions**.

## 🔍 Interests

- Physics 
- Mathematics 
- Algorithms and computational complexity
- Experimental and empirical approaches to theory
- Scientific programming (C/C++)

## 🧪 What I work on

Most of my projects revolve around:

- Implementing simple algorithms and studying their behavior
- Measuring performance, limits, and scalability
- Comparing deterministic and random approaches
- Writing code with a clear separation between measurement, visualization, and interpretation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

- **C/C++** (experiments, performance measurement, low-level control)
- **Python & MANIM** (Animations and Geometries)
- LaTeX (Redacted Documents)
- Git & GitHub
- Basic data analysis and plotting tools

## 📌 Notes

This profile is a work in progress. 
I’m more interested in *asking the right questions* than in pretending to already know the answers.

Thanks for stopping by.
